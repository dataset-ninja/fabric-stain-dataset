**Fabric Stain Dataset** is a dataset for object detection and classification tasks. It is used in the textile industry. 

The dataset consists of 466 images with 870 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*stain*).

Images in the Fabric Stain dataset have bounding box annotations. There are 68 (15% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the dataset. Alternatively, the dataset could be split into 2 classification categories: ***stain*** (398 images) and ***defect free*** (68 images). The dataset was released in 2020 by the <span style="font-weight: 600; color: grey; border-bottom: 1px dashed #d3d3d3;">Intellisense Lab of University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka</span>.
