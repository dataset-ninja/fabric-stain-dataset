**Fabric Stain Dataset** is a dataset for an object detection task. It is used in the textile industry. 

The dataset consists of 466 images with 870 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*stain*).

Images in the Fabric Stain Dataset dataset have bounding box annotations. There are 68 (15% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 2 splits in the dataset: *defect_free* (68 images) and *stain* (398 images). The dataset was released in 2020 by the [Intellisense Lab of University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka](https://uom.lk/cse/labs/IntelliSense).
