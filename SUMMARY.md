**Fabric Stain Dataset** is a dataset for an object detection task. It is used in the textile industry. 

The dataset consists of 398 images with 870 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*stain*).

Images in the Fabric Stain Dataset dataset have bounding box annotations. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the dataset. The dataset was released in 2020 by the Intellisense Lab of University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka.
